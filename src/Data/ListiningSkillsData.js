Nationalism, when it becomes successful sometimes goes on spreading in an aggressive way and becomes a danger internationally. Whatever line of thought you follow, you arrive at the conclusion that some kind of balance must be found. Otherwise something that was good can turn into evil. Culture, which is essentially good become not only static but aggressive and something that breeds conflict and hatred when looked at from a wrong point of view. How are you find a balance, I dont know. Apart from the political and economic problems of the age , perhaps, that is the greatest problem today because behind it there is tremendous search for something which it cannot found.
